# Data Science Tutorials 

Welcome to the Data Science Tutorials repository! This repository contains tutorials on various data science techniques. 

## Tutorials Available:

1. **Frequentist Generalised Linear Models:**
   - Tutorial: GLM.py
   - Description: In this tutorial, we predict the daily temperature in a city based on historical dew point, humidity, UV index and precipitation data from https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api.
  
2. **Bayesian Generalised Linear Models:**
   - Tutorial: GLM_Bayes.py
   - Description: In this tutorial, we infer the coefficients of a Generalised Linear Model on self-consistent synthetic data.
  <br/><br/>
   - Exercise: Cepheids_Bayes.py
   - Description: Infer the parameters of the Cepheid period - luminosity relation using the data in http://www.physics.uwyo.edu/~jessicas/teach/astron/cephiedperiodlum.pdf. 

## Usage:

- Each tutorial follows the following structure:
   1. How the algorithms works
   2. What its tunable parameters are
   3. What diagnostics we can use to assess the algorithm's performance on a dataset
   4. How we can improve its performance

- The code is written in Python.

- Clone the repository to your local machine and request access to the data by the author in order to run the scripts, if the data are not present in the repository.
